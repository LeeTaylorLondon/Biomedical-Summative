MRI brain images of patients with different severity of dementia/Alzheimer's
disease (very mild, mild, moderate) and a healthy control group.

Research questions:
- are the train and test sets well chosen?
- how well can we classify the images?
- can the results be improve with transfer learning?
- which class is the easiest/hardest to predict?
- what do "difficult" images (for which mistakes are made) have in common?
- do classifiers work better with a binary problem (non-demented vs. rest)?
- is there some pre-processing possible to improve the prediction?
- which parts of the images are used in the best model's decisions?
